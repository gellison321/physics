# This is an answer guide to the physics book, The Theoretical Minimum by Leonard Susskind

The motivation is to replicate the other answer guides available, and contribute a Python-based computational focus. The analytical solutions are complemented by numerical solutions and visualizations where I found interesting to do so.

Credit to OpenAI and the GPT 4 model. Like all models, it is usually wrong, but always useful. I'm excited to see where this technology goes in the future, and the implications for the acceleration of scientific discovery. It is truly an amazing sidekick.
